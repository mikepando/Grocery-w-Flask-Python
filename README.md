# Grocery Store w/ Flask & Python
This was a project where I created a mock grocery store page using a combination of Flask, Python and HTML.

The page was intended to test Python code with user input on a local server. It accepts user input of quantity, the number of items wished to be purchased, and displays it on a billing page with its respective price. The code also prevents users from entering a negative quantity, converting it to 0.

### Prerequisites
The requirements to run this project are fairly simple. You will need:
```
Spyder IDE with Python 3.7 #or a python interpreter of your choice
```
```
A Web Browser
```

## Instructions
1. Keep all the contents of this repository in one folder. 
2. Open and run the server.py file in your python interpreter.
```
This will initiate the flask server on port 5001
```
3. Open the dls.html file in your web browser.
4. Input the number of each item to purchase and press 'submit order'
5. A billing page will load, displaying order total. 

## Built With
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - The python interpreter used
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Microframework used for local server
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) - The language used

## Disclaimer
This was made for educational purposes. It is not meant to be complex but was intended to test Python alongside Flask.
